The only farm commodity that might possibly qualify is cotton that a producer held over and did not sell until after Jan 15.&nbsp; With harvest occurring in October and November, a very small percentage was left to sell.<br/><br/>2.&nbsp; The Southern Plains is the leading area for wheat pasture graze out producing a significant percentage of the beef going to finishing lots. These cattle do not market until very late April and May, so they were left out of the program. However, they were the most impacted by the crashing fat cattle market due to the packing houses closing because of COVID-19.<br/><br/>3.&nbsp; The breeding stock operations normally sell the bulk of their production on &quot;special breeding stock sales&quot; during late March and April. Due to COVID-19 these sales were all postponed until May.&nbsp; Again, these producers were left out of the program.<br/><br/>I am most appreciative of any agriculture producers being assisted and I truly hope the suffering operations receive relief that they need.<br/><br/>However, it seems it was intended to only help a select group. Administering an arbitrary date previous to a specific regional market that eliminated them from the program does not provide equal opportunity.<br/><br/>Any attention that you could give to this issue would be greatly appreciated.<br/><br/>",

    "comment": "On behalf of the National Association of Egg Farmers representing shell egg and liquid egg farmers, we are pleased to offer comments on the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program &quot;additional commodities request for information&quot; as requested by the Farm Service Agency (FSA-2020-0004-003). <br/><br/>Beginning May 26th, farmers were able to file for aide from the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program. At that time egg farmers producing liquid egg for foodservice establishments were excluded because liquid egg and shell egg farmers were combined into a single category with the statement  &ldquo;Commodities that did not suffer a five percent-or-greater price decline from mid-January 2020 to mid-April 2020 are not eligible for CFAP. Specifically, this includes sheep more than two years old, eggs/layers, soft red winter wheat, hard red winter wheat, white wheat, rice, flax, rye, peanuts, feed barley, Extra Long Staple (ELS) cotton, alfalfa, forage crops, hemp, and tobacco. USDA may reconsider the excluded commodities if credible evidence is provided that supports a five percent price decline.&rdquo; <br/><br/>We appreciate that USDA stated they may reconsider the excluded commodities (eggs/layers) if credible evidence is provided that supports a five percent price decline. National Association of Egg Farmers offers the following evidence supporting its claim of a five percent decline. The egg market has two distinct markets, shell eggs and egg products. These two distinct types of laying hen farms utilize different processes and equipment to supply their customers. In fact, the shell egg market experienced a short-lived spike while the liquid egg market fell to a record low. For distinction between the various markets for eggs, the following prices were gathered from UDSA data between mid-Jan and mid-April 2020:  <br/>Liquid egg price decreased from $0.25 to $0.08 per pound<br/>Dried egg price decreased from $2.15 to $2.02 per pound<br/>Shell egg price increased from $0.79 to $1.79 per dozen<br/><br/>Because these farms, processes, and markets are not interchangeable, this fact sheet focuses on the egg product market. <br/><br/>&bull; Commodities are required to have a 5% decline in price from mid-January to mid-April to qualify their farmers for the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program. USDA data for processed (liquid) egg shows that the price in mid-Jan 2020 was $0.2465 per pound and in mid-April it was $0.0771 per pound. This 68.7% price decline is significantly greater than the 5% price decline threshold required to qualify for the CFAP program. Because USDA data is not complete, other sources can be used to verify the accuracy of this information. Urner-Barry reported a 59% decrease from $0.270 per pound to $0.112 per pound during the same time frame. Both sources support a finding that this commodity has suffered more than a 5% loss in market value. <br/><br/>&bull; USDA data from the Weekly Shell Eggs Processed Under Federal Inspection Report shows that liquid edible egg production is the lowest it has been since December 2009. The five-week running average of edible liquid egg production by mid-May 2020, was 29% lower than the same period of 2019 and the lowest since January 2004. <br/>&bull; FDA created a temporary pathway to move eggs from the liquid market into the shell egg market; however, this wasn&rsquo;t applicable to many farmers because 1) their flocks were ineligible due to a requirement for hen age less than 45 weeks, 2) eggs could not be packaged with equipment that was available, and 3) retailers were generally not willing to accept alternative egg packaging. <br/>&bull; Many customers imposed the force majeure clause in their contracts and stopped taking delivery of egg products. As a result, egg farmers needed to dispose of liquid egg product through unpaid channels. <br/>&bull; While liquid egg can be dried for longer shelf life, dried egg product inventories at the time of the COVID outbreak were close to an all-time high. This, along with limited dryer capacity and increased cost, limited liquid egg supplies being converted into dried egg as a viable option. <br/>&bull; Some farmers were able to molt their flocks to temporarily reduce egg production. Flocks molted at the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak are coming back into full egg production while the market is still low. <br/>&bull; The national flock size has dropped by almost six million layers during April in addition to the 10 million laying hen reduction during the first quarter of 2020. National Association of Egg Farmers urges the FSA and AMS help these egg farmers utilize the provisions in CFAP since they too lost more than five percent of their value during COVID19.<br/>Thank you.<br/>Ken Klippen, President<br/>National Association of Egg Farmers<br/><br/>",

I am mainly a Pima cotton grower and can not believe that my crop was not included in as an eligible commodity. I have lost a substantial amount of money starting with my 2018 crop due to tariffs imposed on my cotton and can`t even sell my crop to China, Vietnam and other countries because of the Covid 19. That is due to the fact that the cotton mills are shut down. Meanwhile I am being charged storage fees that ad up to be probably 10 cents a pound. This is a more than a 5% loss not including the loss in price since the beginning  of the year",

I lost 30 cents a pound on my crop which equates to a $200000 dollar loss! I kept waiting for China to lift the tariff but they haven`t done what they have promised and since the china virus I still have 325 cotton bales to sell. You can`t sell them because the cotton mills in China are shut down. In the mean time I am paying storage fees every month and the interest that I am paying to my bank is excessive. I was floored when I heard Pima cotton was considered an ineligible commodity. I just can`t believe it!",

    "comment": "We would like to urge the USDA to designate ELS cotton as a CFAP eligible Non-specialty crop.  As ELS cotton growers in California, we have been significantly impacted by the commodity price drop due to COVID-19.  Our family farm has been farming ELS cotton for 40 years in California&#39;s Central valley.  Three generations of our family have dedicated our lives to farming.  We provide jobs for families in our small community.  We farmed 1200 acres of ELS cotton in the 2019 crop year.  The costs to farm cotton have increased due to increased water costs, labor costs, storage costs, and other input costs such as; seed, fertilizer and insecticides.  In good times, our profit margin is tight for ELS cotton and in this current economic crisis, it is impossible to support our 2020 growing crops without assistance.  <br/>We believe ELS cotton should be considered for program assistance for the following reason:<br/>1. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant loss in demand for ELS cotton.  The retail apparel industry has been completely disrupted because of the COVID-19 pandemic.<br/>2. This reduction in the demand for ELS cotton has resulted in larger carryover stocks, and higher storage and interests costs.<br/>3. ELS cotton export sales have virtually stalled since March while shipments dropped off significantly in mid-April.<br/>4. Trade data published by U.S. Census Bureau indicate a decline in ELS market prices between January 2020 and April 2020.  ELS cotton prices, as measured by per-pound export values declined by $.08 per pound, or 7.2% between January and April.<br/>5.  The latest price decline meets the 5% threshold established in CFAP over the appropriate timeframe.<br/>6.  With decreased demand and delayed shipments, growers are facing higher storage and interest charges.  When added to the market decline of 8 cents, the overall impact of lower prices and increased marketing costs is 10.7 cents.<br/><br/>Given the current economic situation, ELS producers are in dire need of the timely assistance that can be provided through CFAP.<br/>",

My name is Tom Toretta and I am one of the partner/owners of Toretta Farms, I am also on the Board of Directors at  Farmers Co-Op Gin in Kern County and Ranchers Cotton Oil, a cotton seed marketing Co-Op. ELS cotton is one of the main crops produced by growers in our area and is very important financially to the economy in our area.  The recent COVID-19 pandemic crisis has negatively affected not only the ELS market but ag commodities as a whole. Because of the COVID crisis there has been a loss in demand for ELS cotton, since the retail apparel industry has also suffered from the COVID crisis they are not buying our cotton, this has resulted in larger carryover stocks. . 2.Storage and interest cost have increased due to lack of demand for ELS cotton, as the export markets for ELS cotton have virtually been stalled resulting in cotton have to stay in storage longer. 3. U.S. Census Bureau data indicates a decline in ELS prices of $0.08 per pound or or 7.2% between January and April, this decline meets the  5% price decrease threshold and timeframe threshold by the CFAP. All of these factors and the current economic climate means that ELS producers are in need of CFAP assistance. <br/><br/>Thank you,<br/>Tom Toretta<br/><br/>",

The demand for Pima has seriously dropped since the Covid19 crisis has been recognized around the world.  Demand for Pima has been greatly diminished due to Covid19.. Shipments of ELS have almost stopped during this Covid19 pandemic.  This results in higher carryover stocks, higher storage and interest charges.

We are a small family farm of 300 acres with no employees and currently grow supima cotton, alfalfa, corn, wheat and pistachios.<br/><br/>As we all know the COVID 19 pandemic has had a profound effect on most, if not all, aspects of agriculture; but I write you today to address the concerns of the USDA not designating ELS cotton as eligible under the CFAP guidelines.  When I first heard there was going to be funds helping farmers to off cut severe losses to demand due to COVID-19, there was little doubt in my mind that ELS cotton would meet the criteria.  It was definitely a shock to read it was not included, as the price decline in the specified date range most certainly meets the 5% threshold that CFAP established as criteria for the funding. <br/><br/>Of the five commodities that we grow, no other commodity has come close to what has been lost financially in cotton due to COVID 19.   When the retail apparel industry came to a halt, so did the sale of ELS cotton.   ALL ELS cotton export sales have been stalled since March with a significant drop in shipments in mid-April.  The U.S. Census Bureau has reported a decline in ELS market of 7.2% between January 2020 and April 2020. <br/><br/> I must also add that the timing of COVID-19 just as tariffs were starting to be lifted has been crippling to our cotton farming side of business.  Because of tariffs, the ELS cotton demand was already suffering for 18 months prior to the pandemic.  With Covid-19, ELS cotton in now being turned into a larger carryover stock with higher storage and interest costs.   When adding the storage and interest cost to the 7.2% market decline,it again leaves me baffled on why it is not included in the list of commodities under the CFAP guidelines.   <br/><br/>Under the current requirements, none of the other commodities we grow (corn, wheat, alfalfa and pistachios) met the criteria due to various reasons, and it made sense as it pertains to our farming business on why they didn&rsquo;t.  But as mentioned earlier, ELS cotton does and I urge you to provide timely assistance to ELS cotton farmers through CFAP.

Our farm produces a variety of commodities like tomatoes, pistachios, and ELS cotton. This year, 2020, has been the most devastating for our farm because of the Covid 19 pandemic and the many negative financial consequences that followed and still persist . Markets are stagnant or negative which makes it very difficult for processors and marketers to sell any of our products. ELS cotton is one of the hardest hit commodities in our business, ELS cotton product retailers have been closed or operating at a minimal level. Demand for ELS cotton has evaporated and we are sitting on most of our 2019 crop that is still not sold.  We are having cash flow issues as a result which are having a huge negative impact on our business operations .  Our farm like many others today are feeling the pain from this unfortunate time in our history and are asking for ELS cotton to receive the non speciality crop recognition so we can receive much needed relief at this time.<br/>Thank You for your time and attention to this important issue and God Bless our Farmers !! <br/>Sincerely,<br/>Jeremy Freitas",

    "comment": "These comments are in support of designating ELS cotton a CFAP eligible Non-Specialty Crop.  My name is Kirk Gilkey, I am a third generation farmer in Corcoran California.  My family started growing ELS or Pima cotton in the mid-1990&#39;s.  ELS has bee a successful crop for our family farm over the years even though heavy regulation makes farming in California the most expensive farming venture in the world.  The Covid-19 pandemic has been responsible for a great downturn in demand for ELS cotton.  Shipments from January 2020 through today have been almost non-existent.  This fact has resulted in larger carry-over stocks, higher storage and interest expenses  According to trade data published by the US Census Bureau ELS cotton prices have declined as measured by per-pound export values by $.08 per pound or 7.2 % between January and April of 2020.The 7.2% is only the decrease in price, the added storage and interest expenses add to the problem.  This 7.2% decline is well above the 5% threshold required to be eligible for CFAP.  Family farmers like mine will be in big trouble with our 2019/20 ELS crop without the assistance that should be provided by CFAP.  Please reconsider American ELS and approve ELS as an eligible CFAP Non-Specialty Crop.  Thanks You..",

We grow Supima cotton, alfalfa, corn, wheat, and pistachios.  We have no employees and farm approximately 300 acres.<br/><br/>The effects of COVID 19 on our farming operation have been profound.  Of all of the commodities that we grow cotton has suffered the worst. Because of tariffs, the demand for Extra Long Staple (ELS) cotton was already suffering for 18 months prior to the pandemic.  As the pandemic progressed the retail apparel industry has been completely disrupted, and the effect on the cotton market has been disastrous.  Export sales have stalled, resulting in larger carryover stocks, and higher interest and storage costs.  ELS cotton prices, as measured by per-pound export values have declined by 8 cents per pound, or 7.2% between January and April, and they continue to fall.  This coupled with higher storage, interest, and marketing, drives that decline to almost 11 cents per pound.  <br/><br/>The small amount of assistance we received as a result of the tariffs provided some relief to a market that was already tumultuous.  I was shocked to hear that the USDA did not designate ELS cotton as CFAP eligible.  It most definitely meets the 5% threshold that was established as a criterion for funding.  I can only assume that it was a mistake by USDA and I urge you to correct this mistake immediately.  ELS producers are in dire need of the assistance that USDA can provide.<br/><br/>Please review the impact to the ELS market and amend the eligible commodities to include Extra Long Staple cotton.  <br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration of this matter.<br/><br/>Regards,<br/><br/>Nick Deftereos<br/>Deftereos Farms<br/>11660 7th Avenue<br/>Hanford, CA.  93230<br/>559-901-6951<br/>nickdeftereos@hotmail.com<br/>",

    "comment": "We are submitting these comments in support of the USDA designating ELS cotton as a CFAP eligible non-specialty crop.<br/> <br/>Since the start of the coronavirus outbreak, no economic sector has been affected more than apparel and home linen retail sales. This is particularly true given that the outbreak started in China, which is the largest producer of ELS products worldwide and the largest consumer of U.S. ELS cotton. Problems with China, carried over from the trade war, began as soon as the pandemic started in that country with immediate shutdowns of production facilities. This was quickly followed by the shutting down of almost all textile production facilities and retail outlets worldwide.<br/> <br/>As might be expected, this has had dire consequences for ELS growers in the U.S., the largest exporter of ELS cotton in the world. More than any other commodity, sales have all but stopped since February. The entire supply chain is faced with little liquidity at any price and the little business concluded has occurred at prices well below production costs. In addition, unlike growers of upland cotton, ELS growers are having to pay for the cost to carry this inventory with no alternatives available. When added together, price loss, carry charges, and a slow recovery of demand with little hope of price appreciation for the rest of the year, ELS growers are facing conditions that the CFAP was designed to help. Furthermore, there is another crop in the ground that will be harvested this fall and add to the burdensome inventory. Given the different levels of government program support than upland cotton growers, ELS growers are facing a greater hardship than upland cotton growers.<br/> <br/>Because the current loan program does not help growers with carry charges, ELS growers are seeing reduced net pricing weekly as storage charges continue to accrue with no relief in sight. The upland grower has relief from storage via the marketing loan mechanism when prices fall. The Pima grower is at a distinct and unanticipated disadvantage due to the COVID-19 consumption reductions and delays. When and if the textile supply chain returns to normal, the ELS grower will have seen a continuous decline in net prices beyond anything experienced before. Your program represents the only possible help in relieving this adverse economic reaction to a global problem.  ",

My cotton is still sitting in a warehouse not being sold due to the shrinking world demand which has resulted in record low prices of ELS cotton. The price of cotton is below the cost of production. Prices continue to fall while the cost of producing keeps increasing. With decreased demand and delayed shipment, we as growers are facing higher storage and interest charges.

I farm a few hundred acres of which 50% is dedicated to growing ELS cotton.  I have personally been effected by the COVID-19 pandemic through the significant loss of demand for ELS cotton.  Shipping ports have been closed, spinning and yarn mills have been closed, and ELS cotton export sales have become virtually non existent.  Trade data published by the US Census Bureau indicate a decline in ELS cotton market prices of approximately 7.2 % between January and April of 2020.  This price decline meets and even exceeds the 5% threshold established in CFAP over the appropriate time frame.  Synthetic fibers (petroleum based) have become less expensive to manufacture due to the oil prices being  so historically low this year, which gives synthetics an unfair advantage in this distorted market.  The pandemic is creating added expense for me personally by having to pay for storage of my cotton crop in order to try to hold it until prices become more favorable.

This has and continues to put pressure on producers by increasing interest and storage cost by not being able to timely market their ELS cotton.   I ask on behalf of all producers that this commodity be added to the list of eligible crops.  The American family farmers and the businesses that depend on use have all been affected and we must help them through this process of working through this unexpected event.  Our rural communities depend on the family farmer and our urban cities depend on rural America for all their basic needs even if they don&rsquo;t realize it.

    "comment": "Hello,<br/><br/>I am a third generation farmer in the Central Valley of California. We run a family farm operation that includes growing ELS cotton.  I am writing to request that the USDA designate ELS cotton as a CFAP eligible non-specialty crop.  I was disheartened to learn that ELS cotton was not determined eligible when it clearly meets the CFAP requirement of a 5% or more decline in market price due to the impact of COVID-19 - the decline is actually more than 7% between January 2020 and April 2020.  CFAP funds have been earmarked for the purpose of providing financial relief to farmers impacted by price decline and additional marketing costs for inventories due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  ELS cotton meets the price decline criterion and the intended purpose of CFAP relief.  Due to COVID-19, the apparel and textile industry, including exports, have came to screeching halt.  This has increased the supply to levels never previously contemplated.  Additionally, there are minimal alternative markets for ELS cotton outside of textiles and apparel and none that able to provide any meaningful impact on oversupply and market price.  Global markets are also not viable alternatives as exports have essentially stalled since March.  The increased marketing and storage costs result in an even greater loss to farmers on top of the substantially lower market price.  <br/><br/>The USDA should also consider the parallel of the designation of wool as a CFAP eligible non-specialty crop.  Similar to ELS cotton, wool is used for textiles and apparel and market price is significantly effected by export markets.  However, for some reason, wool was designated as CFAP eligible while ELS cotton was not, despite the fact that ELS cotton meets both the 5% or more market price decline and additional marketing costs criteria outlined in the CFAP. <br/><br/>Based on the above and with the consideration of the thousands of small family farms that this decision directly affects, I humbly request that the USDA reconsiders its decision to not designate ELS cotton as a CFAP eligible non-specialty crop. <br/><br/>Respectfully, <br/><br/>Diandra Netto Vantrease <br/>Netto West Farming ",

Never in three generations have we faced the economic impact that we are facing today. Last year &#39;1019&#39; was one of the lowest yielding years we have had in recent history. Now we are looking at $1.00 - 1.05 per lb. when we were getting $1.40 - 1.50 per lb. the tariffs are affecting us badly. China is one of our major export countries. For this reason I think that pima cotton should be included in the CFAC program.",
